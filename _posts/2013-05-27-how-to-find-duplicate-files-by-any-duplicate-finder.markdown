There are three steps to finde duplicates, I will demonstrate you how to find the duplicate song(s) by Any Duplicate Finder (ADF):







1.Finde the iTunes Library




It's usually the iTunes Library locates at /Users/xxx/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media, the "xxx" is the current user's name. Drag it to ADF to scanning path area, once you find the right iTunes Media path;

3. chose the file(s) you want to delete, and click delete it.







**PS. It's very important to make sure your spotlight is working ok now, since ADF dependents the spotlight to find the duplicate file(s) more fast. To make sure your spotlight is ready by clicking the spotlight icon (right-top on the statu bar, pic 1), you will find the spotlight like pic 2.**
