ImagePrivacyClean can remove metadata from image files in batch. It is able to thoroughly remove image's metadata such as EXIF(including thumbnail & comments), Photoshop image resources(including IPTC), GPS information (Geotags), and other hidden data types while keeping the image intact and without degrading its quality. This metadata often contains information such as the exact date and time the photograph was taken, the digital camera manufacturer and unique serial number, the camera settings, and the location (if GPS-enabled camera was used). With ImagePrivacyClean you can prevent the unintentional exposure of this information that many compromise your privacy and cause you embarrassment.
