WMA is the easiest way to get your WMA files to play in iTunes and your iPhone or iPod. Drag in your FLAC files and they get imported into iTunes. Simple.

You can select the output tunes audio formats (MP3, ACC, ALAC). The music metadata also can be saved in the converter progress with your personal settings, so you can see all the original music's metadata( album's artworks, aritist, album, lyric, etc) on your iPhone or iTunes.

If you want to add other format music, such as WMA, Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Speex, AC-3, you can download the other product named MusicTunes.
